title: "Loops in R"
teaching: 30
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can I do the same thing multiple times more efficiently in R?"
- "What is vectorization?"
- "Should I use a loop or an apply statement?"

objectives:
- "understand loops types and create them"
- "identify and perform vectorized operations"
- "identify and understand when to use loops or vectorized operations"

keypoints:
- "loops consume computer resources and should be used sparingly"
- "R has vectorized operations to make classical looping operations faster"
